# Exploring Reproducibility and Replicability: Attempting to Reproduce Methodology of Vulnerability Analysis

### Background

Reproducibility and replicability of scientific research is becoming more widely recognized as an essential component of a robust scientific method in academic research. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine defines and differenaties the two as such: *reproducibility* aims to obtain the same results by using the same input data and methodology while *replicability* aims to answer the same question using different different data and similar methodologies (2019). Adopting these processes in scientific research not only allows for a greater scrutiny of one's methodology but opens up new avenues of communication and transparency between researchers. Reproduciblity and replicabiltiy are instric to an open-science that not only allows for self-correction but sees it as beneficial to the scentific community as a whole (Sui 2014).



### Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to attempt to reproduce the methodology of Malcomb et al.'s

### Software

The following softwares were used to complete this exercise:

* [QGIS 3.10](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
* [PostgreSQL with PGAdmin 4 v4.26](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-macos/)
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
