# Reproducing CyberGISX Analysis: Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accesibility of COVID-19 Healthcare in Connecticut

### About 

In their paper, "Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources: A Case Study of Illinois, USA", Kang et al. implement a methodology that measures and visualizes the access that two different populations, COVID-19 patients and the population risk (defined as those over 50), have to two important resources, ICU beds and Ventilators. 

To rapidly measure accessibiity to Covid-19 healthcare, Kang et al. developed a methodology for [parallel implementation](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/parallel-computing#:~:text=Parallel%20computing%20refers%20to%20the,part%20of%20an%20overall%20algorithm.) of an Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2FSCA) methodology. This method calculates the ratio between a service (in this scenario, hospital ICU beds or ventilators) and a population with a surrounding area, accounting for distance decay. Because this is a computationally intensive analysis hat uses large street networks, the authors developed a parallel-E2FSCA (P-E2FSCA), which enables the use of up to 4 processors while implementing the analysis.

The following resources document their methodology, data, and results:
* [Paper](Paper/Kang_spatialAccessibilityCovid.pdf): an overview of the problem, description of and conceptual methodology, results, and conclusion
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/rapidly-measuring-spatial-accessibility-of-covid-19-healthcare-resources-a-case-study-of-illinois-usa/): a reproducible implementation of the paper's methodology (requires a [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/registration/) account)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/cybergis/COVID-19AccessibilityNotebook): has the notebook and all the necessary data
* [Where COVID-19 Spatial Access Dashboard](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html): A live dashboard that displays the daily accessibility calculated from this methodology

### Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to replicate Kang et al's methodology, using Jupyter Notebook on their CyberGISX platform, to calulate spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources in Connecticut. I will briefly summarize their methodology, walk through the process of acquiring and processing the necessary data for Connecticut, show and explain the code modifications that were made to Kang et al's Notebook for this replication, explain the results, and comment on the methodology and the process of replication.  

*Important*: 
* Most of the code is an exact replication of Kang et al.'s methodology (unless explicitly noted, it should be assumed that any code was written by Kange et al.)
* Note on reproducibility: the notebook was run in the CyberGISX environment, so even with the data and notebook provided, my replication is only exactly reproducible within the CyberGISX platform. Otherwise, you will need to install all of the python packages on your local jupyter platform, and then the notebook should work.

### Software

* [QGIS 3.10](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) on [CyberGISX Platform](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/registration/)
